      <h3>Southern province branch</h3>
       <p> In 2016, while searching for materials in the Ruhango district, we came across women with physical disabilities who were already experienced weavers. We have keenly incorporated them into TTA and they are now an indispensable part of our basket-weaving circles. They are in total 30 women and the number is growing. In May 2018, we have launched English classes thought by Peace Corps Volunteers, working and living in Southern province.</p>

      <h3>Rwamagana branch</h3> 
        <p>We have approached a new group of 35 women in and around Rwamagana town in June 2019 and started training them in basket weaving. Most of these women were just staying at home, some of them even hiding because of their disabilities. We have now given them a new hope and they are all excited to learn and produce beautiful crafts.</p>
